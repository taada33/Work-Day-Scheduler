# Work Day Scheduler


## Description

This application allows the user to schedule events during business hours of 9am to 5pm. When an event is saved into a time block, the text is saved to local storage. The text is pulled from local storage when the day is refreshed. Each hour block is color-coded such that past events are colored grey, present events are colored red, and future events are colored green.
